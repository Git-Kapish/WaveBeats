Smart, webcam-driven media control using hand gestures ‚Äî a small prototype that maps simple gestures to media actions for hands-free playback control.

Tagline: Control playback and volume with intuitive hand gestures (play, pause, skip, volume) using OpenCV + MediaPipe.

---

## Description

WaveBeats captures a live webcam feed, extracts hand landmarks with MediaPipe, and maps a concise set of gestures into system media actions. It is designed as a lightweight, extendable prototype to explore gesture-driven interaction for media playback.

Core behavior is implemented in `main.py` (capture & UI), `gestures.py` (gesture detection), and `actions.py` (system key mapping).

## Purpose

This project serves two goals: it's a personal, hands‚Äëfree media controller you can actually use, and a compact demo of computer vision, gesture recognition, and OS automation skills. It showcases practical engineering decisions (threshold tuning, cooldowns, fallbacks) and provides a clear, extensible codebase recruiters and technical reviewers can inspect. The implementation is intentionally small and readable so developers can adapt or extend gestures quickly.

## Features

- üëç Thumbs Up ‚Üí Volume Increase
- üëé Thumbs Down ‚Üí Volume Decrease
- ‚á† Swipe Left ‚Üí Previous Track (increased sensitivity)
- ‚á¢ Swipe Right ‚Üí Next Track (increased sensitivity)
- ‚úã Palm ‚Üí Play/Pause

## Tech stack

- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV (`cv2`) ‚Äî camera capture & display
- MediaPipe Hands ‚Äî hand landmark detection
- `pyautogui` / `keyboard` ‚Äî send hotkeys and media keys (platform-dependent)
- Standard Python libs: `math`, `collections`, `json`

Key files:
- `main.py` ‚Äî main capture loop and overlay
- `gestures.py` ‚Äî gesture detection heuristics
- `actions.py` ‚Äî maps gestures to system/media actions
- `utils.py` ‚Äî cooldown and history helpers
- `config.json` ‚Äî runtime thresholds and options

## Installation (Windows ‚Äî PowerShell)

1. Clone the repository and open PowerShell in the project folder.
2. Create & activate a virtual environment and install requirements:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```powershell
python main.py
```

Notes:
- On Windows you may need to run PowerShell as Administrator for `keyboard` to send global media keys reliably.
- If you run on macOS or Linux, see the Limitations section below for platform notes.

## How to use

- Launch the app. The webcam preview shows the detected gesture at the top-left.
- Perform clear gestures (stand/sit at a consistent distance). The app uses a cooldown to avoid accidental repeats.
- Tune `config.json` values such as `swipe_norm_threshold`, `pinch_threshold`, and `rotation_angle_threshold` if detection is too sensitive or too strict.

---

## Limitations

- Platform differences:
	- Vision pipeline (OpenCV + MediaPipe) is cross-platform.
	- Sending media keys is platform-dependent: the current implementation targets Windows primarily. macOS often requires AppleScript or Accessibility permissions for reliable control; Linux behavior varies by desktop environment.
- Some media players ignore simulated media keys when unfocused. Web players (Chrome, Spotify Web) are usually more responsive to hotkeys like Ctrl+Right / Ctrl+Left.
- Gesture detection is heuristic-based and sensitive to lighting, camera angle, and user distance.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the overlay always shows `none`: verify webcam feed and landmarks are visible; adjust thresholds in `config.json`.
- If gestures appear on-screen but actions don't run: try running the terminal as Administrator (Windows) or validate `pyautogui` / `keyboard` independently.
- If next/previous don't work for a specific player: try the same action in a browser tab (Spotify Web / YouTube) where hotkeys are usually handled.

Ideas (after discussing via issues):
- Add macOS handlers in `actions.py` (AppleScript for Music/Spotify)
- Add new gestures in `gestures.py` or unit tests for `utils.py`
